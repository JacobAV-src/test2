# üé¥ DevOps Challenge ‚Äì Pok√©mon Card Binder

Welcome, Trainer! Complete DevOps tasks, close issues, and earn Pok√©mon trading cards for your efforts!

### ü™Ñ How it works:
1. At the top of the JacobAV-src/PokeOps-User repo, you should see a 'Use this template' option. Select it > Create a new Repository.
2. Enter any repository name you wish. You can choose it to be Public / Private. (GitHub Pages needs your repo to be public.)
3. IMPORTANT : Give permission to the workflow to write in Repo by going to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow Permissions > Select Read and Write Permissions > Save.
4. After the repo is created, Open the Issues Tab up top and click 'New Issue'.
5. Your Issue template should be automatically applied. Enter your Devops Tasks or Goals into the file. (Note : Do NOT change the [TASK COMPLETED] title part, it has to be there for the Github Actions to detect and trigger.)
6. Once you've completed all the tasks, **close the issue**
7. Our GitHub Action will contact the card-minting backend and fetch your reward üéÅ
8. Cards appear inside the `/docs/` folder and show up on your [Binder](https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please enable GitHub Pages (from the `/docs` folder) in your repo via Settings.

# Please Note
- This is a honor-based system, which expects you to finish your tasks and close the Issues truthfully.
- Use the tool responsibly.
